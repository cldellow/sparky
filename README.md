# sparky

Sparky consists of three projects:

- [data](data) - A disgusting collection of bash and python scripts to collect data from servers.
- [server](server) -  A Scala project written with the Spark web framework to expose the data via REST.
- [ui](ui) - A React single-page-app to visualize the data.
